# diamondanalysis

The following analysis was created to investigate 3 questions regarding the Diamond business:

Oftentimes people without knowledge assume the larger a diamond (carat) the more valuable it is, this is not always true and can it be demonstrated easily in a visual that can be interpreted by a layman?
Are there any other surprising patterns?
Can a predictive model of price be created with a good level of accuracy that utilises both numerical and categorical qualities of Diamonds?

Note: The underlying data was obtained from Kaggle in order to prove the potential of such a model; however, its likely the prices stated do not reflect the market conditions of 2020.

The project uses the following libraries - numpy, pandas, scikit learn and seaborn.

The project discovers that it is possible build an accurage predictor, finds an interesting clustering of carat sizes and explores some visualisations of the data.
